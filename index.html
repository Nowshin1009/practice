            <h1>Chobi</h1>
            <p>She is the girl, with whom I can talk anything,anytime without any hesitation. In school day, we used to
                talk a lot in classes , as well as going an coming back from school since our house were in same path. I
                met her, when we were in class 5. She admitted then and used to be so quite. Actually, our friendship
                started in class 7 and in class 9 we became best-friends. Those were the golden days of my life indeed.

            <h1>Jahid</h1>
            <p>Meet my less brother,more friend! HaHa...Yes, in true words, He is not my biological brother, still I
                never left the lack of a elder brother because of him. He is such a humble and good-hearted person I
                ever met in my lifetime. His honesty and well-mannered behavior is his identity. He cares a lot for me
                and also sometimes becomes rude if I take some bad decision. I think, If i had a elder brothe, he would
                be just like Jahid vaiya!

            <p>As you can see,she is as pretty as her name. Not only name, Her heart is more pretty than anything. We
                are friends from childhood like when we were in class 4! But our actual friendship began when we were is
                class 6. And then suddenly we become very close and best-friend. We used to do a lot of mischief
                together. But the saddest part is we did meet for almost 4 year+. I miss her and those moments a lot.
                Still when I talk with her, I feel we are still in school and i met her yesterday! we shares memes and
                make laught each other. I really wish to meet her asap!
